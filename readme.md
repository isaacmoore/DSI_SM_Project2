# General Assembly Project 2: Billboard Hits + Data Munging

### Overview

This week we learned how to craft appropriate problem statements, work with pivot tables, and started learning about Pandas. Additionally, we learned how to clean data and use dummy variables. Now,  we're going to apply some of these newly acquired skills in our second project. Given a dirty dataset, you will do some exploratory data analysis. You will create a Jupyter writeup hosted on GitHub that provides a dataset overview with visualizations, statistical analysis, and data cleaning methodologies.
